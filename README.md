# COGS 107 Final Project

This repository contains code and output for my final project in COGS 107.

## Files

### `sdt_ddm/`

This file is the original provided heirarchical signal detection theory model. The output delta_plots_1 is what is originally analyzed when using this code.

### `sdt_ddm_rev/`

This file is the revised standard detection theory model. It takes into account the effect of the stimulus type and trial difficulty, and tries to look at the convergence. This is shown with both a table and bar graphs, named revised_delta_plot_1. The data can be easily compared.
